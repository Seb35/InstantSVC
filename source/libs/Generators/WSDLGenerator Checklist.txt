4.1 Required Description
------------------------
[x]Either an INSTANCE's WSDL 1.1 description, its UDDI binding template, or both MUST be available to an authorized consumer upon request.
// wir erzeugen ja das WSDL
->This means that if an authorized consumer requests a service description of a conformant service instance, then the service instance provider must make the WSDL document, the UDDI binding template, or both available to that consumer. A service instance may provide run-time access to WSDL documents from a server, but is not required to do so in order to be considered conformant. Similarly, a service instance provider may register the instance provider in a UDDI registry, but is not required to do so to be considered conformant. In all of these scenarios, the WSDL contract must exist, but might be made available through a variety of mechanisms, depending on the circumstances.

4.4 Messages
------------

-=4.4.1 Bindings and Parts=-
 [x]A document-literal binding in a DESCRIPTION MUST, in each of its soapbind:body element(s), have at most one part listed in the parts attribute, if the parts attribute is specified.
 // wir haben da eigentlich KEIN part-element, ansonsten, da DOC, wird auch überall höchstens ein part erzeugt...
 [ ]A wsdl:binding in a DESCRIPTION SHOULD bind every wsdl:part of a wsdl:message in the wsdl:portType to which it refers with a binding extension element.
 [ ]If a document-literal binding in a DESCRIPTION does not specify the parts attribute on a soapbind:body element, the corresponding abstract wsdl:message MUST define zero or one wsdl:parts.
 [ ]A wsdl:binding in a DESCRIPTION MAY contain soapbind:body element(s) that specify that zero parts form the soap:Body.
 [ ]An rpc-literal binding in a DESCRIPTION MUST refer, in its soapbind:body element(s), only to wsdl:part element(s) that have been defined using the type attribute.
 [ ]An ENVELOPE described with an rpc-literal binding MUST NOT have the xsi:nil attribute with a value of "1" or "true" on the part accessors.
 [ ]A wsdl:message in a DESCRIPTION MAY contain wsdl:parts that use the elements attribute provided those wsdl:parts are not referred to by a soapbind:body in an rpc-literal binding.
 [ ]A document-literal binding in a DESCRIPTION MUST refer, in each of its soapbind:body element(s), only to wsdl:part element(s) that have been defined using the element attribute.
 [ ]A binding in a DESCRIPTION MAY contain soapbind:header element(s) that refer to wsdl:parts in the same wsdl:message that are referred to by its soapbind:body element(s).
 [ ]An ENVELOPE MUST contain exactly one part accessor element for each of the wsdl:part elements bound to the envelope's corresponding soapbind:body element.
 [ ]In a doc-literal description where the value of the parts attribute of soapbind:body is an empty string, the corresponding ENVELOPE MUST have no element content in the soap:Body element.
 [ ]In a rpc-literal description where the value of the parts attribute of soapbind:body is an empty string, the corresponding ENVELOPE MUST have no part accessor elements.

also:

Use of wsdl:message elements with zero parts is permitted in Document styles to permit operations that can send or receive envelopes with empty soap:Bodys. Use of wsdl:message elements with zero parts is permitted in RPC styles to permit operations that have no (zero) parameters and/or a return value.

For document-literal bindings, the Profile requires that at most one part, abstractly defined with the element attribute, be serialized into the soap:Body element.

When a wsdl:part element is defined using the type attribute, the serialization of that part in a message is equivalent to an implicit (XML Schema) qualification of a minOccurs attribute with the value "1", a maxOccurs attribute with the value "1" and a nillable attribute with the value "false".

It is necessary to specify the equivalent implicit qualification because the wsdl:part element does not allow one to specify the cardinality and nillability rules. Specifying the cardinality and the nillability rules facilitates interoperability between implementations. The equivalent implicit qualification for nillable attribute has a value of "false" because if it is specified to be "true" one cannot design a part whereby the client is always required to send a value. For applications that want to allow the wsdl:part to to be nillable, it is expected that applications will generate a complexType wrapper and specify the nillability rules for the contained elements of such a wrapper.

-=4.4.2 Bindings and Faults=-
 [ ]A wsdl:binding in a DESCRIPTION MUST refer, in each of its soapbind:header, soapbind:headerfault and soapbind:fault elements, only to wsdl:part element(s) that have been defined using the element attribute.

 [ ]A wsdl:message in a DESCRIPTION containing a wsdl:part that uses the element attribute MUST refer, in that attribute, to a global element declaration.

-=4.5.1 Ordering of part Elements=-
 [x]The order of the elements in the soap:body of an ENVELOPE MUST be the same as that of the wsdl:parts in the wsdl:message that describes it.

 [x]A DESCRIPTION MAY use the parameterOrder attribute of an wsdl:operation element to indicate the return value and method signatures as a hint to code generators. 
 // geht auch ohne, gerade bei DOC LIT

 [ ]A wsdl:binding in a DESCRIPTION MUST NOT use the parts attribute on contained soapbind:header and soapbind:headerfault elements. -> The WSDL Schema gives the attribute's name as "parts" and its type as "NMTOKENS". The schema is incorrect since each soapbind:header and soapbind:headerfault element references a single wsdl:part.

 [ ]If an INSTANCE receives an envelope that is inconsistent with its WSDL description, it MUST check for "VersionMismatch", "MustUnderstand" and "Client" fault conditions in that order.

 [ ]A HTTP request MESSAGE MUST contain a SOAPAction HTTP header field with a quoted empty string value, if in the corresponding WSDL description, the soapAction of soapbind:operation is either not present, or present with an empty string as its value. 

-=4.7.26 SOAP Binding Extensions=-
 [ ]A CONSUMER MUST understand and process all WSDL 1.1 SOAP Binding extension elements, irrespective of the presence or absence of the wsdl:required attribute on an extension element; and irrespective of the value of the wsdl:required attribute, when present.

 [ ]A DESCRIPTION MAY use any construct from XML Schema 1.0.

 [ ]A DESCRIPTION MUST use XML Schema 1.0 Recommendation as the basis of user defined datatypes and structures.

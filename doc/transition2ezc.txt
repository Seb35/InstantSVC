Usage of ezComponents for self implemented features

Console
Settings
	ezcConfigurationManager - looks nice, if it's as speedy an easy to use as 
							  the current solution with simple array includes
							  it could be a good choice.
							  Probably it's a bit slower, may be it's not for be
							  used in rest.php or soap.php but in the deployment
							  descriptor generators.
Database
DatabaseSchema
	The Schema handling looks nice and portable.
	At the moment we are using a sql script (mysql) to generate the database
	and a modified phpmyadmin sql parser, which is GPL. So this should be
	removed.
	With different databases in mind a sql script is less portable, but could be
	easily tweaked for a different database.
	At the moment there is no plain SQL import for the DBSchema manager but a 
	an xml file including the db schema for installation should be easy to use
	to especialy for tooldriven installation.
	
File
	ezcFile
		may be we could contribute the relative path method?
Base
	ezcBaseStruct
		think it's a good choise for some of the data types defined like
		FileDetails

PhpGenerator
	Why to use it? Seams not add any benefit?

SystemInformation
	While Console-Tools have problems on Windows (doesn't understand ANSI escape
	sequences) used to dectivate format infos on win32.

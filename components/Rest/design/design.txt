eZ component: ReST, Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Design description
------------------
ezcRestServer
	This class provides a server for ReSTful Web Services. It deserializes
	incoming requests into PHP data types and calls the correspondent method of
	an application class. The output of the method is serialized and returned to
	the client with the HTTP response. Additionally it is able to authenticate
	users via HTTP Digest authentication.

ezcRestDigestAuth
	This class handles HTTP Digest Authentication for ReST services.

ezcRestSerializer
	This interface has to be implemented by serializers and deserializers in
	order to be used with the ReST server.

ezcRestXmlSerializer
	This class implements a serializer to produce XML output for a ReST
	service.

ezcRestXmlDeserializer
	The counterpart of the XML serializer is this deserializer which is able to
	parse XML input.

ezcRestPearSerializer
ezcRestMapping
ezcRestMappingTable

ezcRestDdGenerator
	This generator class provides an API to create deployment descriptors for
	ezcSoapServerDispatcher which are actually include files returning a PHP
	array with configuration settings.
